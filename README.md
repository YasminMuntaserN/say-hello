## How SignalR Powers Real-Time Features
 **The SignalR library plays a critical role in enabling real-time communication for the chat application:**
**Persistent Connection:** SignalR establishes a continuous connection between the server and clients, ensuring real-time delivery of messages.
**Message Flow:**
When a user sends a message, it is transmitted to the SignalR Hub on the server.
The hub processes the message and instantly broadcasts it to the intended recipient(s).
All participants, whether in private or group chats, receive the message in real time.
**Group Chat Synchronization:**
SignalR manages group communication, ensuring every group member receives messages simultaneously, maintaining consistent state across all devices.

**By utilizing WebSockets, SignalR guarantees efficient and seamless communication, even under varying network conditions.**
